After reviewing the attached spreadsheet, I can confirm that the below servers are part of our scope and are currently running unsupported kernel versions:

mpdevcusvmlsrespl01 (RHEL 7.9 – kernel 3.10.0-1160.83.1.el7.x86_64)

mpedjqs1vmlspluni01 (RHEL 7.9 – kernel 3.10.0-1160.92.1.el7.x86_64)

We are reviewing the patching options and assessing the required downtime. I will share the planned patching timeline shortly and keep you updated on the progress.

Please let me know if there are any specific guidelines or blackout windows we should be aware of.
