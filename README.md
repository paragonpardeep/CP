I need a quick clarification on the CrowdStrike health dashboard request. From my understanding, this looks more aligned with SRE scope rather than CD-TOOLS, as it involves endpoint health monitoring and integrations. Can you please confirm whether we should take this up under CD-TOOLS or route it to the SRE team / check with the CD-TOOLS owner first?
