🔍 Problem Statement

Today, support and SRE teams spend significant time:

Searching across multiple tools for known issues, runbooks, or troubleshooting steps.

Copying links, notes, and commands between platforms manually.

Losing time during incidents due to lack of centralized knowledge retrieval.

This leads to:

Increased MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution)

High context switching, reducing focus and productivity

Inconsistent knowledge sharing across teams
