I have noticed that some RUM/MZ tickets are being closed without user confirmation of successful traffic after RUM onboarding.

To ensure quality, please follow these steps for all RUM/MZ or code change tickets:

Request user validation in the development environment after onboarding changes.
After user approval in development, deploy to production and request validation again.
Only close the ticket after user confirms everything is working in production. If needed, use the three-strike follow-up process.
For any questions, please reach out to me.

Thank you.
