💡 Proposed Solution

Develop an AI-powered virtual assistant within ELITEA that can:

Connect to multiple data sources (ServiceNow, Jira, Confluence, SharePoint, GitHub).

Understand context (incident ID, issue type, priority, etc.)

Fetch, summarize, and recommend relevant solutions or KB articles instantly.

Assist in ticket updates, comments, and status changes directly via ELITEA.

Enable natural language queries, e.g.

“Show me similar incidents in the last 3 months for this error code.”
“Fetch runbook for database connection timeout.”
