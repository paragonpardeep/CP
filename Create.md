Today, we conducted our first monthly call to review and gain an understanding of the Twistlock documentation. A big thank-you to Ken for providing a comprehensive overview of the document.

Next Steps:
Ken will notify us about the upcoming Twistlock tasks. We will begin with reverse shadowing, followed by performing the activity in shadow mode, and then eventually take full ownership of this task.
